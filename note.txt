RNNs

time series analysis

predict based on prev data

sequential information

predict just not on current or one input, based on data and trend

RNN ~ memory capture information

same Networks

inout diff times

prev hidden state

multi-dimension neurons as one neuron

copy the same Networks for the number of timesteps

hidden units

timestep

diff inputs at diff times

activation functions
    Sigmoid
